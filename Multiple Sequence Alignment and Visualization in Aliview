# Combining and Aligning Sequences

## Download additional sequences: wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/9jssqegt5ml18nh/ACE2_seq.fa

## Combine sequences:
cat new_seq.fa ACE2_seq.fa >>combined.fa

## Count sequences:

grep -c ">" combined.fa

# Downloading Genome Sequence Data from NCBI and Combining with the combined.fa File

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/

1. Entered "Homo sapiens transcripts" in the search bar
2. Located the transcript data file in the results (.fa.gz format).
3. Copied Link Address
4. Downloaded the Data Using wget in terminal

wget https://example.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/transcripts.fa.gz

# Uncompressing the Downloaded File

gunzip transcripts.fa.gz

# Extracting the Target Gene

grep "ACE2" transcripts.fa

# Extracting the gene sequence, including the FASTA header and its sequence. 

grep "ACE2, transcript variant 1" transcripts.fa -A42 >> combined.fa


# Verifying the combination by checking the contents of the combined.fa file:

grep -c ">" combined.fa


# Making a multiple sequence alignment
 Downloaded Clustal Omega using wget http://www.clustal.org/omega/clustal-omega-1.2.3-macosx
 Renamed the Downloaded File for convenience:
 mv clustalo-1.2.4-Ubuntu-x86_64 clustalo or mv clustal-omega-1.2.3-macosx clustalo

# Making the File Executable

chmod u+x clustalo

# Performing the Alignment

./clustalo -i combined.fa -o ACE2.aln

-i combined.fa: Specifies the input file containing sequences to align.
-o ACE2.aln: Specifies the output file for the alignment results.

# Visualize the Alignment
