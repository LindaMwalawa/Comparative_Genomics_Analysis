# Evolutionary Analysis of ACE2 gene.
This involved the following steps:

## De novo Assembly of ACE2 using velvet

1. Qaulity control using Fastqc
2. Trimming adapater and removing low quality bases (Phred >33)using Trimmomatic
3. Assembly of the Qc reads using velveth and velvetg
4. Validation of consensus contigs in NCBI

## Evolutionary analysis of assembled ACE2 contigs in Myotis bats species 
1. Blast the ACE2 contigs ....
2. Download ... and combine with ACE2 contig
3. Alignment
4. visualization using Aliview
5. Phylogenetic tree inference analysis using IQ-tree
