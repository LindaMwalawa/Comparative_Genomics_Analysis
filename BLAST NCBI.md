# Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for Assembled Reads

NCBI BLAST homepage: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

Selected the Nucleotide BLAST (BLASTN) tool since I was working with nucleotide sequences

Copied assembled sequence from the "contigs.fa" file

Pasted the sequence into the “Enter Query Sequence” text box on the BLASTN webpage

Ensured the species name matched experimental goal (Myotis brandtii for bat sequences)

Determined Strand Orientation and reverse-complemented the sequences sing https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html

Pasted assembled sequences, generated the reverse complement, and saved it as a new file: nano new_seq.fa
